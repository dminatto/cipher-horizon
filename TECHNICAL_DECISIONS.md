## Introduction

### Purpose of Technical Decision Documentation

This document captures the critical technical decisions and associated trade-offs made during the design and implementation of CipherHorizon, providing insight into the rationale behind our architectural choices.

## Architectural Paradigm Selection

### Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture

![Architectural Paradigm Selection - Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture](assets/architectural-paradigm-selection.png)

#### Decision: Microservices Architecture

**Rationale:**

- Enhanced scalability
- Independent service deployment
- Technology stack flexibility
- Improved fault isolation

**Trade-offs:**

- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- More challenging distributed system management

### Polyglot Programming Approach

#### Decision: Multi-Language Implementation

**Languages Chosen:**

- Golang: Performance-critical services
- Python: Machine learning
- Rust: Systems programming components

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros:
  - Leverage language strengths
  - Optimize performance-critical components
  - Flexibility in development
- Cons:
  - Increased complexity in cross-service communication
  - Potential inconsistent coding standards

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Communication Protocols

```PROTOBUF

// gRPC Service Definition
syntax = "proto3";

service CryptoAnalyticsService {
    // Unary RPC for market data retrieval
    rpc GetMarketData(MarketDataRequest) returns (MarketDataResponse) {}

    // Streaming RPC for real-time updates
    rpc SubscribeMarketUpdates(SubscriptionRequest)
        returns (stream MarketUpdate) {}
}
```

#### Decision: gRPC with Protocol Buffers

**Rationale:**

- High-performance RPC mechanism
- Strong typing
- Language-agnostic
- Efficient serialization

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros:
  - Low latency
  - Compact message encoding
  - Strong contract definition
- Cons:
  - Learning curve
  - Limited human readability
  - Debugging complexity

### Event Streaming Platform

#### Decision: Apache Kafka

**Key Considerations:**

- Distributed streaming
- High throughput
- Replay capabilities
- Fault tolerance

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros:
  - Scalable message processing
  - Event sourcing support
  - Multi-subscriber model
- Cons:
  - Operational complexity
  - Additional infrastructure overhead
  - Learning curve

## Microservices Design Trade-offs

### Service Boundaries

#### Decision: Domain-Driven Service Decomposition

**Principles:**

- Clear bounded contexts
- Minimal inter-service dependencies
- Single responsibility
- Independent scalability

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros:
  - Improved maintainability
  - Easier independent deployment
  - Clear domain separation
- Cons:
