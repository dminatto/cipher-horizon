# Communication Protocols - gRPC and Protocol Buffers Selection

## Issue

The platform requires an efficient, type-safe, and high-performance inter-service communication mechanism that supports complex data exchange and minimal overhead.

## Discussion

Modern distributed systems face significant challenges in service communication:

- High-latency communication
- Inefficient data serialization
- Lack of strong typing
- Complex versioning management
- Limited cross-language compatibility

Traditional communication methods like REST and JSON:

- Suffer from performance bottlenecks
- Lack strong type safety
- Require manual serialization/deserialization
- Limited streaming capabilities
- Verbose message formats

Emerging communication technologies offer more robust solutions, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of inter-service communication strategies.

## Solution

Implement gRPC with Protocol Buffers as the primary inter-service communication mechanism, leveraging:

- High-performance RPC framework
- Strongly typed service definitions
- Efficient binary serialization
- Bidirectional streaming support
- Language-agnostic interface definition

## Status

Accepted

## Group

Communication Architecture

## Assumptions

- Development team can learn gRPC concepts
- Infrastructure supports HTTP/2
- Performance gains justify implementation complexity
- Services require real-time, efficient communication

## Constraints

- Increased initial development complexity
- Requires code generation
- Limited human-readable message formats
- Debugging challenges

## Positions

1. REST with JSON

   - Widely understood
   - Human-readable
   - Simple implementation
   - Limited performance

2. GraphQL

   - Flexible querying
   - Client-driven data fetching
   - Overhead in complex scenarios

3. gRPC with Protocol Buffers

   - High performance
   - Strong typing
   - Efficient serialization
   - Streaming capabilities

4. Apache Thrift

   - Similar to gRPC
   - Less community support
   - Limited streaming features

## Argument

gRPC selected due to:

- Exceptional performance characteristics
- Strong type safety
- Efficient binary serialization
- Native streaming support
- Wide language support
- Active community and tooling

## Implications

- Requires code generation tools
- Changes in service communication patterns
- Need for advanced serialization strategies
- Potential refactoring of existing interfaces
- Enhanced inter-service contract management
