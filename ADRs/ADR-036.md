# Microservices Design - Domain-Driven Service Decomposition

## Issue

The platform requires a robust microservices architecture that effectively separates concerns, enables independent scaling, and maintains clear domain boundaries.

## Discussion

Microservices architecture presents complex challenges in service decomposition:

- Defining clear service boundaries
- Managing inter-service dependencies
- Maintaining data consistency
- Enabling independent deployment
- Balancing granularity vs. complexity

Traditional monolithic approaches fail to address:

- Scalability limitations
- Technology diversity requirements
- Independent team ownership
- Rapid iteration and deployment

Key considerations for service decomposition:

- Domain-specific functionality
- Data ownership
- Communication patterns
- Performance implications
- Organizational structure

## Solution

Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for microservices decomposition:

- Clear bounded contexts
- Service-specific data models
- Minimal inter-service dependencies
- Event-driven communication
- Independent scalability

Proposed Core Services:

1. Market Data Service
2. Trading Signal Service
3. Risk Management Service
4. Portfolio Tracking Service
5. User Management Service
6. Compliance Monitoring Service

## Status

Accepted

## Group

Architecture Design

## Assumptions

- Team understands domain-driven design
- Services can be independently developed
- Event-driven communication is feasible
- Performance overhead is acceptable

## Constraints

- Increased architectural complexity
- Potential data duplication
- More sophisticated monitoring required
- Advanced inter-service communication

## Positions

1. Monolithic Architecture

   - Simpler initial implementation
   - Easier data consistency
   - Lower operational complexity

2. Domain-Driven Microservices

   - Clear domain separation
   - Independent scalability
   - Technology flexibility
   - Improved maintainability

3. Modular Monolith

   - Compromise between monolith and microservices
   - Easier refactoring
   - Limited scalability

## Argument

Domain-Driven Microservices selected due to:

- Precise domain boundary definition
- Independent service scaling
- Technology stack diversity
- Improved system maintainability
- Alignment with complex trading domain

## Implications

- Complex inter-service communication
- Advanced event streaming requirements
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for comprehensive monitoring
- Potential performance overhead
