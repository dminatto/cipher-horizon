## Status

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded

## Prologue (Summary)

In the context of building a distributed cryptocurrency trading analytics platform,  
facing challenges of complex domain logic, scalability, and independent service evolution,  
we decided to implement a domain-driven microservices architecture  
to achieve flexible, scalable, and maintainable system design  
accepting the increased operational complexity and initial development overhead.

## Discussion

- Scalability and performance needs
- Independent service evolution
- Technology diversity
- Deployment and management complexity

### Current Landscape

- Monolithic architectures limitations
- Growing complexity of trading systems
- Need for rapid innovation
- Varied technological requirements across domains

### Key Requirements

1. Independent service deployment
2. Technology stack flexibility
3. Horizontal scalability
4. Domain-driven design
5. Fault isolation
6. Continuous deployment
7. Independent scaling

### Constraints

- Limited computational resources
- Team expertise
- Development and operational costs
- Performance overhead

## Solution

### Microservices Architecture Design

#### Core Service Domains

1. **Data Ingestion Service**

   - Collect market data
   - Normalize exchange information
   - High-performance processing

2. **Market Analysis Service**

   - Complex trend analysis
   - Statistical modeling
   - Predictive indicators

3. **Trading Signal Generator**

   - Strategy implementation
   - Risk-weighted signal scoring
   - Automated recommendations

4. **Risk Management Service**

   - Portfolio risk assessment
   - Position sizing
   - Compliance monitoring

5. **Notification Service**

   - User alerts
   - Personalized insights
   - Multi-channel communication

### Technical Implementation

#### Service Interface Definition

```PROTOBUF
syntax = "proto3";

service MarketAnalysisService {
  rpc AnalyzeMarketTrends(MarketDataRequest) returns (MarketAnalysisResponse);
  rpc GeneratePredictiveIndicators(HistoricalDataRequest) returns (PredictiveIndicatorsResponse);
}

message MarketDataRequest {
  repeated MarketTick market_data = 1;
  AnalysisParameters parameters = 2;
}

message MarketAnalysisResponse {
  repeated TrendIndicator trends = 1;
  double confidence_score = 2;
}
```

#### Service Communication Protocol

- gRPC for inter-service communication
- Protocol Buffers for serialization
- Apache Kafka for event streaming

#### Technology Stack Diversity

- Golang: Performance-critical services
- Python: Machine learning services
- Rust: Systems programming components

#### Service Discovery and Configuration

```yaml
# Service Discovery Configuration
services:
  market_analysis:
    image: cipherhorizon/market-analysis
    replicas: 3
    resources:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 4Gi
    scaling:
      min_replicas: 2
      max_replicas: 10
      cpu_threshold: 70%
```

### Design Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**

   - Bounded contexts
   - Clear service responsibilities
   - Minimal inter-service dependencies

2. **Polyglot Persistence**

   - Choose optimal database per service
   - Time-series for market data
   - Document store for user preferences
   - Relational for complex relationships

3. **Event-Driven Communication**

   - Asynchronous messaging
   - Eventual consistency
   - Decoupled service interactions

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Flexible and adaptable architecture
- Independent service scaling
- Technology stack diversity
- Improved fault isolation
- Faster development cycles

### Potential Risks

- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency
- Distributed system challenges
- Eventual consistency trade-offs

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Distributed tracing
- Performance optimization

## Performance Metrics

### Target Specifications

- Service response time: < 100ms
- Horizontal scalability: 10x current load
- Service independence: 99.99% uptime
- Deployment frequency: Multiple times per day

## Specific Implementation Details
