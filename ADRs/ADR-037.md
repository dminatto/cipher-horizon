# ADR-037: Data Management Strategies - Polyglot Persistence Approach

## Issue

The platform requires a sophisticated data storage strategy that can efficiently handle diverse data types, performance requirements, and domain-specific persistence needs.

## Discussion

Modern distributed systems face complex data management challenges:

- Varied data access patterns
- Performance inconsistencies
- Limited schema flexibility
- Scalability constraints
- Domain-specific storage requirements

Traditional single-database approaches fail to address:

- Diverse data representation needs
- Performance optimization
- Scalability limitations
- Domain-specific query capabilities

Key considerations for data management:

- Performance characteristics
- Data model complexity
- Query requirements
- Scalability needs
- Consistency models
- Cost-effectiveness

## Solution

Implement a Polyglot Persistence approach with carefully selected databases:

- InfluxDB: Time-series market data
- MongoDB: Trading strategies and flexible documents
- PostgreSQL: Relational data and complex queries
- Redis: Caching and real-time data processing

Implementation principles:

- Database selection based on domain requirements
- Clear data ownership
- Eventual consistency model
- Efficient data synchronization
- Minimal data duplication

## Status

Accepted

## Group

Data Architecture

## Assumptions

- Team has multi-database expertise
- Infrastructure supports diverse database deployments
- Performance gains justify complexity
- Eventual consistency is acceptable

## Constraints

- Increased operational complexity
- Data synchronization challenges
- Potential consistency issues
- Higher infrastructure costs

## Positions

1. Single Relational Database

   - Simplicity
   - Strong consistency
   - Limited performance
   - Inflexible schema

2. NoSQL Single Database

   - Flexibility
   - Scalability
   - Weak consistency
   - Limited query capabilities

3. Polyglot Persistence

   - Optimized performance
   - Domain-specific storage
   - Flexible data modeling
   - Advanced querying

4. Cloud-Managed Database Services

   - Reduced operational overhead
   - Managed scalability
   - Limited customization
   - Potential vendor lock-in

## Argument

Polyglot Persistence selected due to:

- Optimal performance for specific domains
- Flexible data modeling
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Independent scalability
- Technology-specific strengths

## Implications

- Complex data synchronization
- Advanced monitoring requirements
- Increased development complexity
- Need for comprehensive data migration strategies
- Performance optimization challenges
