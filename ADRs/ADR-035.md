# Event Streaming Platform - Apache Kafka Selection

## Issue

The platform requires a robust, scalable event streaming infrastructure to handle complex, real-time data processing across multiple microservices.

## Discussion

Modern distributed systems demand sophisticated event streaming capabilities:

- High-volume data processing
- Real-time event propagation
- Fault-tolerant message handling
- Complex event routing
- Historical data replay

Existing messaging systems present limitations:

- Limited scalability
- Poor fault tolerance
- Inconsistent event processing
- Complex distributed management
- Performance bottlenecks

The event streaming platform must support:

- Cryptocurrency market data streams
- Trading signal propagation
- Risk management event processing
- Audit and compliance logging
- Cross-service communication

## Solution

Implement Apache Kafka as the primary event streaming platform, leveraging:

- Distributed streaming capabilities
- High-throughput message processing
- Fault-tolerant architecture
- Event sourcing support
- Scalable partition management

## Status

Accepted

## Group

Event Infrastructure

## Assumptions

- Infrastructure supports distributed streaming
- Team has or can acquire Kafka expertise
- Performance requirements justify complexity
- Event-driven architecture is sustainable

## Constraints

- Operational complexity
- Additional infrastructure overhead
- Learning curve for team
- Potential performance tuning requirements

## Positions

1. RabbitMQ

   - Simpler setup
   - Traditional messaging
   - Limited streaming capabilities

2. Apache Kafka

   - Distributed streaming
   - High throughput
