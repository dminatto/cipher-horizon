### Data Model Examples

#### Time-Series Market Data

```PROTOBUF
message MarketTick {
    string exchange = 1;
    string symbol = 2;
    double price = 3;
    double volume = 4;
    int64 timestamp = 5;
}
```

#### Trading Strategy Document

```json
{
  "_id": "strategy_123",
  "name": "Momentum Trading",
  "type": "momentum",
  "rules": [
    {
      "indicator": "RSI",
      "condition": "above_70",
      "action": "sell"
    }
  ],
  "risk_profile": {
    "max_loss": 0.05,
    "volatility": 0.2
  }
}
```

### Inter-Database Synchronization
