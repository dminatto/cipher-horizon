# Technology Stack Selection - Polyglot Programming Approach

## Issue

The platform requires a flexible and high-performance technology stack that can address diverse computational needs across different service domains.

## Discussion

The current technological landscape demands a multi-dimensional approach to software development, particularly in a complex domain like cryptocurrency trading analytics. Traditional single-language approaches fail to address the nuanced performance and capability requirements across different system components.

Key challenges include:

- Performance-critical service implementation
- Machine learning model development
- Systems programming requirements
- Efficient cross-service communication

Potential risks of a monolithic language approach:

- Performance bottlenecks
- Limited language-specific capabilities
- Reduced flexibility in technology adoption
- Increased development friction

## Solution

Implement a polyglot programming approach with strategic language selection:

- Golang for performance-critical services
- Python for machine learning and data science
- Rust for systems programming and low-level optimizations

## Status

Accepted

## Group

Technology Stack

## Assumptions

- Development team has cross-language expertise
- Infrastructure supports multi-language deployment
- Interoperability between languages is feasible
- Performance gains justify complexity

## Constraints

- Increased complexity in cross-service communication
- Potential inconsistent coding standards
- Additional tooling and infrastructure requirements
- Learning curve for team members

## Positions

1. Single Language Approach (e.g., Python)

   - Simplicity
   - Consistent development
   - Easier knowledge sharing

2. Polyglot Programming
