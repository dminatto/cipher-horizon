### Feature Engineering Strategies

#### 1. Comprehensive Feature Generation

```python
class FeatureEngineeringPipeline:
    def __init__(self, data_sources):
        self.sources = data_sources
        self.feature_generators = [
            TechnicalIndicatorGenerator(),
            SentimentFeatureGenerator(),
            BlockchainMetricGenerator(),
            MacroeconomicFeatureGenerator()
        ]

    def generate_features(self, market_data):
        features = {}
        for generator in self.feature_generators:
            features.update(generator.generate(market_data))
        return features
```

#### 2. Feature Categories

#### 3. Dynamic Feature Selection

```python
class AdaptiveFeatureSelector:
    def select_features(self, feature_set, model_performance):
        feature_importance = self.calculate_importance(feature_set, model_performance)

        selected_features = self.rank_features(feature_importance)

        return self.prune_features(selected_features)

    def calculate_importance(self, features, performance):
        # Machine learning-based feature importance
        pass

    def rank_features(self, importance_scores):
        # Ranking and selection logic
        pass
```

### Feature Transformation Techniques

    repeated string related_features = 5;
}

enum FeatureType {
    TECHNICAL_INDICATOR = 0;
