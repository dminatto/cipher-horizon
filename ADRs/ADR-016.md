### Personalization Strategies

#### 1. Comprehensive Insights Framework

```python
class PersonalizedInsightsGenerator:
    def __init__(self, user_profile):
        self.profile = user_profile
        self.insight_modules = [
            InvestmentProfileAnalyzer(),
            RiskToleranceModule(),
            MarketKnowledgeAssessment(),
            PerformanceContextualizer(),
            LearningPreferenceAdapter()
        ]

    def generate_insights(self, market_data):
        personalized_insights = []
        for module in self.insight_modules:
            module_insights = module.analyze(
                market_data,
                self.profile
            )
            personalized_insights.extend(module_insights)

        return self.curate_insights(personalized_insights)
```

#### 3. Insights Schema

```PROTOBUF
message PersonalizedInsight {
    string insight_id = 1;
    InsightType type = 2;
    double relevance_score = 3;
    map<string, string> insight_details = 4;
    ActionRecommendation recommendation = 5;
    VisualizationType visualization = 6;
}

enum InsightType {
    PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE = 0;
    MARKET_TREND = 1;
    RISK_ASSESSMENT = 2;
    INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITY = 3;
    EDUCATIONAL_CONTENT = 4;
}
```

### Intelligent Insights Generation

```python
class InsightsGenerationEngine:
    def generate_personalized_content(self, user_profile, market_context):
        insight_generation_strategies = {
            'performance_focused': self.generate_performance_insights,
            'educational_focused': self.generate_learning_insights,
            'risk_mitigation_focused': self.generate_risk_insights
        }

        selected_strategy = insight_generation_strategies[
            user_profile.primary_insight_preference
        ]

        return selected_strategy(user_profile, market_context)
```
